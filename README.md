# HumanShape™ AR

HumanShape AR™ is a mobile Augmented Reality app that uses statistically accurate 3D body shape models. The models featured in the app were developed at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) based on analyses of 3D laser scans of hundreds men, women, and children with diverse a range of anthropometric characteristic like stature, age, and BMI. The app is being developed with Unity3D (Editor version: 2021.3.7f1) and the Vuforia Unity SDK with assistance from UMTRI Biosciences research scientist Dr. Byoung-Keon Daniel Park. 

HumanShape AR™ allows users to manipulate body shape models in real time to fit a diverse range of dimensions like BMI, age, stature, and sitting height. It also allows viewers to accurately view positions of anatomical landmarks on the human body.
